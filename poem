Walk on the Beach

As the Waves are Splashing 

I can feel the water hit my feet as I dig my toes into the sand 

The feeling of playing with my dogs bring a smile to my face 

And the feeling of spending time with my family and friends spreads the joy amongst us all 

The beach makes time fly by so fast while we live in the moment

Ending the best days off watching the sunset
